## Why is my frame handler being invoked twice?

In Frog, there are two render cycles for `.frame` handlers: one for the **"main"** frame endpoint, and **"OG image"** frame endpoint.

If we want to enforce idempotency, we can distinguish between the two cycles by using the [`cycle` property on context](/reference/frog-frame-context#cycle):

```tsx twoslash
// @noErrors
/** @jsxImportSource frog/jsx */
// ---cut---
import { Button, Frog } from 'frog'
import { db } from './db'
 
export const app = new Frog()
 
app.frame('/', (c) => {
  const { buttonValue, cycle } = c // [!code focus]

  if (cycle === 'main') db.save(buttonValue) // [!code focus]

  return c.res({
    image: (
      <div style={{ color: 'white', display: 'flex', fontSize: 60 }}>
        Selected: {buttonValue}
      </div>
    ),
    intents: [
      <Button value="apple">Apple</Button>,
      <Button value="banana">Banana</Button>,
      <Button value="mango">Mango</Button>
    ]
  })
})
```
